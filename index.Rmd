# Biodiversity crisis

* Biodiversity has been undergoing significant changes mainly due to increase and acceleration of human activities

* Acceleration of species extinction: the current rate of extinction is estimated between 10s to 100s times higher than the background rate

* Collapse of species abundance

* Road to the sixth mass extinction

# Decomposition of biodiversity changes

* Changes in biodiversity can be decomposed into underlying mechanisms:

$\mathbf{\Rightarrow}$ **Species richness change into colonization and extinction**

$\mathbf{\Rightarrow}$ **Abundance change into recruitment and loss**

* From a conservation perspective, it is important to know the influence of those underlying mechanisms and how they are influenced by scale

# Chapter I: Results

* Scale dependence of changes in species richness, functional diversity, and temporal $\beta$-diversity

* Species richness and functional diversity decrease at global scale, increase at regional scales, and no trend at local scales

* Temporal dissimilarity decreases with increasing grain size

# Chapter I: Discussion

* Challenges of assessing spatial and temporal cross-scale changes due to lack of clear definitions

* Importance of assessing changes at different scales: local for conservation and global to understand the biodiversity crisis

* Understanding that there is no "correct" trend, but rather that biodiversity can show different trends at different scales

# Chapter II: Discussion

* We bring insights on this topic by showing the scale dependence of underlying processes behind species richness change hump-shape pattern of extinction

.pull-left[

**Increase of colonization with scale:** scenario of colonization by external species pool

]

.pull-right[

**Hump-shape pattern of extinction:** range contraction of rare species at local scales and of common species at large scales

]

* Scaling patterns seem to be constant through time

* The difference in the scaling magnitude is due to change in colonization scaling pattern

## Should regional species loss be faster, or slower, than local loss? It depends on density-dependent rate of death

### *(in review)*

# Chapter III: Context

* Following results of **Chapter II** and previous work of Petr Keil

* We wanted to better understand the processes behind the scaling of extinction

* We used 2 simulation frameworks to study the influence of different density-dependence scenario (and few other parameters) on the scaling of extinction (probability and number of extinction)

# Chapter III: Discussion

* Rarity and density-dependence drive the scaling of extinction probability

* Positive scaling can be found only under Allee effect (hypothesis 1), uneven Species Abundance Distribution (SAD), and a one-time loss event (simulation 1)

* A negative scaling of extinction is the most common pattern (hypothesis 2)

* This is because, in the long-term simulations, the probability of extinction tends to eliminate rare or common species, leading to an even SAD and negative scaling of extinction probability

* The scaling of the number of extinction is more variable and depends also on factors affecting the Species-Area relationship (i.e. number of species and intra-specific aggregation)

## Acceleration and demographic rates of bird abundance decline in North America

### *François Leroy, Marta A. Jarzyna, Petr Keil*

### *(in review)*

---

# Chapter IV: Context

* In the context of the great acceleration and acceleration of species extinction, is the decline in species abundance also accelerating?

* Also, changes in abundance arises from a complex interaction between loss and recruitment of individuals

* From a conservation perspective, knowing which process is the most important can be critical for conservation policies

# Chapter IV: Discussion

* Confirming continental decline of bird abundance

* Highlighting regional hot-spots of acceleration in Midwest, Midatlantic and California

* Decline in recruitment rate in Midatlantic region, and increase in loss rate in Midwest and California

* 65% of species and 95% of families with increasing abundance are experiencing a decline in recruitment rate

* Conservation efforts should also be targeted towards seemingly thriving species and not only on loss, but also on recruitment

# Discussion/Conclusion

---

# Biodiversity trends across scales and its decomposition

* We emphasize the importance of considering the scale when assessing biodiversity changes (e.g. global decline vs. local increase, **Chapter I**)

* One can not simply extrapolate biodiversity changes from one scale to another (**Chapter I** and **II**)

* We bring explanations on the scaling of biodiversity changes by decomposing them into colonization/recruitment and extinction/loss (**Chapter II** and **IV**)

* We also provide ecological processes behind the spatial scaling of extinction (**Chapter III**)

* From a conservation perspective, decomposing biodiversity changes can be truly helpful (**Chapter II**, **III**, and **IV**)
